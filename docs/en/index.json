Click \u0026ldquo;Validate rule set\u0026rdquo;, and check rule set is fine. And click \u0026ldquo;Create rule set\u0026rdquo;.\nNext thing to do is linking GameLift Queue and Matchmaking rule set. Click \u0026ldquo;Create matchmaking configuration\u0026rdquo; on the menu. Select queue and rule set like below, and create configuration.   Please check you choose right region and queue.  Creating Lambda function If you deploy CloudFormation stack, Lambda functions have already been made. You should just put required part of these resources.\n\rGameLift FlexMatch configuration was completed! Next step is building Lambda function and API Gateway that game client makes request for FlexMatch. In this lab, we are going to make two Lambda functions. First one is handling matchmaking requests from client, second one is checking matchmaking results. Let\u0026rsquo;s make first Lambda function. It will not be difficult!\n  Move to Lambda Console. https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda\n  Click \u0026ldquo;Create function\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Check \u0026ldquo;Author from scratch\u0026rdquo;.\n  Put the Name of the function \u0026ldquo;game-match-request\u0026rdquo;.\n  Choose Python 2.7 as Runtime.\n  Choose Role on Permissions Tab. Check \u0026ldquo;Use an existing role\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Gomok-game-match-request\u0026rdquo; as IAM Role. Click \u0026ldquo;Create function\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Find Lambda/MatchRequest.py at your source code. Copy the contents and paste it to Console. Check Region and Match Configuration is configured correctly.   Sample Image is just for reference. This can be different from your Lab environment. Also please check Handler and function name is same.  Set Basic settings on your function.   Memory : 128MB Timeout : 1 min   Click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button and make function. This function receives Matchmaking requests from game client, reads user data from DynamoDB and send Matchmaking requests to GameLift.\n  Click \u0026ldquo;Create function\u0026rdquo; button and let\u0026rsquo;s make second function.\n  Check \u0026ldquo;Author from scratch\u0026rdquo; and start with empty function.\n  Put \u0026ldquo;game-match-status\u0026rdquo; as Name, and select Python 2.7 as Runtime.\n  Choose Role on Permissions Tab. Check \u0026ldquo;Use an existing role\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Gomok-game-match-status\u0026rdquo; as IAM Role. Click \u0026ldquo;Create function\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Find Lambda/MatchStatus.py at your source code. Copy source code and paste it to Lambda Code textbox.\n  Like above, set Basic settings on your function.   Memory : 128MB Timeout : 1 min  Please check Lambda functions Handler. Lambda function can access this handler when it is executed.\n\rClick \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button and make function. This function check matchmaking request is done by using TicketId that game clients sent, and send Game server\u0026rsquo;s IP address and Port information to game client as response.  API Gateway Configuration Let\u0026rsquo;s make API for these Lambda functions.\n  Move to API Gateway console. (https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\n  Choose API Gateway that is already made, and click \u0026ldquo;Create Resource\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Write Resource name matchrequest on the box. Check \u0026ldquo;Enable API Gateway CORS\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Create Resource\u0026rdquo; button.   Create new method for this resource. Click \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; button and \u0026ldquo;Create Method\u0026rdquo;. Make API for \u0026ldquo;POST\u0026rdquo; method.\n  Select Integration type with Lambda function, and check correct region. Choose game-match-request for Lambda function and click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button.\n   Make second API for second Lambda function. Click \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; on the root path and \u0026ldquo;Create Resource\u0026rdquo;.\n  Create API as we had. Resource Name will be matchstatus and enable API Gateway CORS.\n   Making POST method, and integrate with game-match-status Lambda function. Click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Now we finish to make APIs for Lambda functions. Let\u0026rsquo;s deploy this API. Click \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; button and \u0026ldquo;Deploy API\u0026rdquo;.\n  After you deploy your API, you can find Invoke URL. This URL will be used for game client.   "

If you want to practice using FlexMatch, you can try Lab 2.\n\rIf a game server is being deployed on Fleet that will handle real game sessions and run logic, you need a matchmaker to properly establish a TCP connection to that server.\nIn general, a session-based game is implemented in such a way that the server for matchmaking is handled by a separate instance, and the server distributes the session to the game server.\nIn this Lab, you are able to use Matchmaker server binary(Matchmaker.exe) or build GomokuMatchMaker project on Visual Studio by yourselves.\n Modify config.ini included with executable matchmaker(.exe).  Specify the Alias ​​created earlier as above, and configure the port settings and service region appropriately. Configure the DynamoDB table name that contains user information also.\nNext, you need to create an IAM Role for the EC2 server where the matchmaker will be configured.

If you want to practice using FlexMatch, you can try Part 2.\n\rIn the previous exercise, we deployed a game server to handle sessions through the GameLift service, and we configured a match server environment to match sessions with GameLift\u0026rsquo;s fleet deployed through the matchmaker server.\nIt is time to play Gomoku! Wow.. it must be so exciting..!\nFor practice, use a game client binary(Classic/client/GomokuClient.exe), or directly build the GomokuClient project in the root folder in Visual Studio. If you build your own binaries, we recommend building in 64-bit Release mode.\n Modify the config.ini file in the root directory of the GomokuClient project.  Set the EIP of the matchmaker server created in the previous chapter, and set the port to connect to. Since the client does not support a separate login function, enter the user information to log in to the configuration file.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have an account, you will be a new member, but please be aware that if the login information does not match, you will not be able to play the game!\n Launch GomokuClient.exe. To play the game Click the right button and press Game Start button. When you start the game, it searches for matching opponents.\n  Once matched, you can enjoy the game! Beat your opponent and become the winner of the Gomoku!\n  The game results are stored in the database and this can be checked through the S3 website endpoint that you configured earlier.   "

We recommend you to build source code compatible to the environment.\n\r  Choose GomokuClient or GomokuServer from given source codes.\n  Open project on Visual Studio or compatible IDE. Projects have dependencies based on Nuget Package, and also for DLL Dependencies for AWS SDK.\n  Set project like below, and build.\n  We recommend you to set \u0026ldquo;Release\u0026rdquo; as build environment. Release folders have already included related dependencies. You can also debug your project with including dependencies.\nGameLift Classic Project and GameLift FlexMatch Project depend on different version of SDK. So those have different functions on their implementations.\nConnect to GameLift Game Server GameLift manage game server resources, but we need to access game server for some reasons such as debugging or accessing logs. If you need to access game server, you can follow this guide below.\nYou need to use CLI for commands.\n Getting instance list from FleetID of the fleet with this command.  aws gamelift describe-instances --fleet-id fleet-4b7fc542-cb08-4f65-908c-737f64ca2e8f --region ap-northeast-2 We could get instance-id of the instance that we want to access. Therefore we can use this command below using FleetId and InstanceId.  aws gamelift get-instance-access --fleet-id fleet-4b7fc542-cb08-4f65-908c-737f64ca2e8f --instance-id i-031278fb03cf29d35 --region ap-northeast-2 Above command gives you the information to access. Access the instance via RDP or SSH. If game server fleet do not authorize to access port, you can configure it in console.  Picture above describes configuration that allows RDP port for the instance. You can configure your fleet as needed.\n "

(https://ap-northeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/product)\n  Set name as FleetIQClient\n  Specify it as an EC2 environment and choose the appropriate instance type. Network settings are configured to be located in the default VPC.   Wait for creation of Cloud9. It will take few minutes.\n  When Cloud9 IDE is executed, create file client.py and paste following code.\n  import socket import boto3 client = boto3.client(\u0026#39;gamelift\u0026#39;) # Claim Game Server def claim_game_server(): pass # response = claim_game_server() #endpoint = response[\u0026#39;GameServer\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;ConnectionInfo\u0026#39;] endpoint = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) client_socket.connect((endpoint, 5000)) while True: data = input(\u0026#34;SEND(TYPE q or Q to Quit):\u0026#34;) if(data == \u0026#39;q\u0026#39; or data == \u0026#39;Q\u0026#39;): client_socket.send(data.encode()) client_socket.close() break else: client_socket.send(data.encode()) data = client_socket.recv(512).decode() print(\u0026#34;RECEIVED:\u0026#34;, data) print(\u0026#34;Socket Closed...

Now let\u0026rsquo;s implement this part.\nYou must implement the claim_game_server function in your code. The claimGameServer API is an API that requests GameLift FleetIQ for a server instance suitable for allocating game sessions to clients. The client only needs to make a request through the corresponding API to connect to the game server. Let\u0026rsquo;s make a code on claim_game_server as follows.  def claim_game_server(): response = client.claim_game_server( GameServerGroupName=\u0026#39;GameServerGroups\u0026#39; ) print(response) return response Function\u0026rsquo;s return value contains Game Server endpoint. Remove comment and set endpoint like below.\nendpoint = response[\u0026#39;GameServer\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;ConnectionInfo\u0026#39;] The complete code is:  import socket import boto3 client = boto3.client(\u0026#39;gamelift\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ap-northeast-2\u0026#39;) # Claim Game Server def claim_game_server(): response = client.claim_game_server( GameServerGroupName=\u0026#39;GameServerGroups\u0026#39; ) print(response) return response # response = claim_game_server() endpoint = response[\u0026#39;GameServer\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;ConnectionInfo\u0026#39;] client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) client_socket.connect((endpoint, 5000)) while True: data = input(\u0026#34;SEND(TYPE q or Q to Quit):\u0026#34;) if(data == \u0026#39;q\u0026#39; or data == \u0026#39;Q\u0026#39;): client_socket.send(data.encode()) client_socket.close() break else: client_socket.send(data.encode()) data = client_socket.recv(512).decode() print(\u0026#34;RECEIVED:\u0026#34;, data) print(\u0026#34;Socket Closed... END\u0026#34;) In the lab, only a simple TCP connection is configured for the purpose of learning to run the FleetIQ API, but the code is simple, but you can practice with more complex game logic.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s see how the server and client interact with the one we created earlier.\n "
